# yFinance-Stock-Analyzer Financial Analysis with Python

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive Python application designed to perform financial analysis on stock market data for the year 2024. Leveraging the yfinance package, this project analyzes stock performance metrics such as up days, realized gain/loss, and 20-day moving averages for user-selected stocks. The application emphasizes code reusability, robust error handling, and professional visualizations using matplotlib.

This project was developed to scale financial analysis with clean, containerized functions and an interactive user interface. It includes a comparative analysis of NVIDIA (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) stocks, showcasing their performance in 2024.

Other users can easily adapt this tool for their own stock analysis. Simply run the individual_stock_analyzer.py script and input any valid stock ticker (e.g., TSLA, META) to analyze its performance within 2024. Choose a specific date range to focus on short-term or long-term trends, select metrics like up days or realized gain/loss to assess daily performance or overall returns, and opt for a plot to visualize price trends and moving averages. The tool’s error handling ensures a smooth experience by guiding you through invalid inputs, making it accessible for beginners and experts alike to explore stock data, compare investments, or build custom reports.


## Features

**Interactive Analysis**: Users can input a stock ticker, date range (within 2024), and choose metrics (up days, realized gain/loss, or both) to analyze.

**Dynamic Visualizations**: Generates plots of closing prices and 20-day moving averages, with an optional bar chart comparing realized gain/loss across stocks.

**Reusable Functions**: Modular functions in utils_Shetty.py handle data downloading, metric calculations, and plotting, ensuring scalability.

**Robust Error Handling**: Validates user inputs (tickers, dates, metrics) with clear error messages to prevent crashes.

**Professional Reporting**: A Quarto-rendered PDF report (financial_analysis.pdf) presents the analysis of NVDA and AAPL with insights and visualizations.

## Visualizations

Below are key visualizations generated by the Stock Analyzer, showcasing stock performance trends and comparisons for NVDA and AAPL in 2024:

**NVDA Stock Price and 20-Day Moving Average**: Displays NVDA's closing price alongside its 20-day moving average, highlighting its volatility and upward trend.

**AAPL Stock Price and 20-Day Moving Average**: Shows AAPL's closing price and 20-day moving average, reflecting a smoother, more stable growth trajectory.

## Key Insights

NVDA achieved a 185.44% realized gain with 140 up days, reflecting strong growth in AI and semiconductor markets.

AAPL recorded a 35.85% gain with 142 up days, indicating stability and consistent performance.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/dheerajshetty07/yFinance-Stock-Analyzer.git

cd yFinance-Stock-Analyzer

2. Install Dependencies: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then install the required packages:
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib

3. Run the Interactive Analyzer:
python individual_stock_analyzer.py

Follow the prompts to input a stock ticker, date range, metric, and plot choice.

View the Report: Open financial_analysis.pdf to explore the NVDA and AAPL analysis, or render financial_analysis.qmd using Quarto.


## Usage

Interactive Mode:

Run individual_stock_analyzer.py and enter a stock ticker (e.g., NVDA), date range (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31), metric (up_days, gain_loss, or both), and whether to display a plot (yes or no).

Type quit to exit.


## Key Achievements

- **Scalability**: Modular functions in utils_Shetty.py are reusable for any stock and date range within 2024.

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation prevents crashes from invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect tickers or date formats).

- **Professional Output**: The Quarto-rendered report is formatted for non-technical audiences, with clear visualizations and insights.

- **Interactive Design:** The individual_stock_analyzer.py script allows dynamic user input, making the tool accessible and flexible.


## Future Enhancements

Add support for multiple simultaneous stock comparisons.

Integrate additional metrics, such as volatility or relative strength index (RSI).

Enhance visualizations with interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.

Expand date range flexibility beyond 2024.
